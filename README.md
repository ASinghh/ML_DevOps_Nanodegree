# ML DevOps Nano Degree
My associated work for the ML DevOps Nanodegree course that I am enrolled for through the online educational services website- Udacity!

## Introduction
In my day-to-day I have been facing the shortcomings of the traditional DevOps practices, when applied to the ML development process. Currently, in my job as the ML Lead for my team, I am responsible for the end to end deployement of a multi-lingual semantic search solution. The task at hand requires traditional components such as, CI-CD, Unit tests, integration tests,etc, but going through the development cycles, we have also identified a need for more ML focused components to,

1. check & monitor quality of the data parser,
2. monitor datashifts,
3. monitor, control and compare the preformance of the model for different languages,
4. log and monitor latency of the data pipeline and the API,
5. collect user journey data for retraining and validation, etc.

In order to fill these gaps in our understanding I have enrolled into Udacity's [ML DevOps Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821), which so far seems to be the only comprehensive and hands-on course focused on this specific area. Each individual repo is focused on their respective module, as in the course.

Please go through them to follow my progress and grade me (if you are my course instructor)!
